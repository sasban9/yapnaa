</li>
<li style="font-size:18px;margin-left:30px;"><p>ii.	Company does not direct, has no control over, makes no representations; and does not guarantee the quality, safety or credibility of the Service Providers, the ability of Service Provider to deliver Services, or that a Service Provider can or will actually complete a transaction.</p>
</li>
<li style="font-size:18px;margin-left:30px;"><p>iii. Registered Users and Service Providers are independent contractors. Company is not responsible for and disclaims any and all liability related to the actions of Registered Users and Service Providers.</p>
</li>
<li style="font-size:18px;margin-left:30px;"><p>iv.	Company’s role is that of an 'intermediary' as defined under the Information Technology Act, 2008 as amended from time to time and the rules thereunder. Being an intermediary, the Company is merely providing a platform to the Registered Users to connect with the Service Providers and thus has no responsibility and / or liability in respect of the Services and transactions being conducted on the Website and/or Application.</p>
</li>
<li style="font-size:18px;margin-left:30px;"><p>v.	Company does not have the obligation to pre-screen or monitor the quality of the Services being provided by the Service Provider at any time. However, Company may elect to monitor and remove any Service Provider from the Website and/or Application if the Company determines in its sole discretion that such Service Provider is rendering Services in violation of the Terms of Use or any applicable law and best practices. Such actions do not in any manner negate or dilute Company's position as an intermediary or impose any liability on Company with respect to the Services offered by the Service Provider.</p>
</li>
<li style="font-size:18px;margin-left:30px;"><p>vi.	If Company suspects any illegal, wrongful or fraudulent activity on the Software by You, notwithstanding any other rights Company may have, Company reserves the right to inform the relevant government or law enforcement authorities.

</li>
<li style="font-size:18px;margin-left:30px;"><p>v.	Notwithstanding the foregoing, you agree that since the company only seeks to provide a platform wherein the registered user and service providers can be brought together and the company itself has no role in the execution or provision of services itself, the company shall not be responsible or liable for any loss or damage of any sort whatsoever incurred as a result of any such transaction or dealings.
